I am the second of two boys,\n              my\n              older brother is Zach.\n              My father has been a practicing labor lawyer for over 40 years working mostly with unions. My mom was a stay\n              at home mom and also\n              a choreographer on the side.\n              I grew up in a small town, Point Lookout, on the south shore of Long Island about an hour east of the city.\n          </p>\n  \n          <p> After high school, I left New York to attend the University of Colorado at Boulder. I studied communication\n              and\n              graduated in 2010 with a\n              Bachelor of Arts. Following college, I moved to Park City, Utah to enjoy a year as a ski bum. It was\n              probably\n              the best year of my life.\n              I worked in a restaurant and skiied over 100 days.\n          </p>\n  \n          <p> After my ski bum year ended, I moved back to New York and settled in Williamsburg, a section of Brooklyn. I\n              worked in the city doing benefits\n              administration for collectively bargained union health and pension funds. After about 2.5 years of that, I\n              moved\n              back to Denver because it seemed\n              as if something was missing. I moved back almost six years ago now and have found a truly enjoyable life\n              here in\n              Colorado.\n          </p>\n  \n          <p> I decided to get into coding while at my last job. The company ran their own coding boot camp and that is\n              what\n              first truly made me think about it.\n              After leaving that company I came to the decision that this was the best decision for me and for my future.\n          </p>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default About;\n","import React from \"react\";\n// import NavTabs from \"./NavTabs\"\nimport \"../../style.css\";\n\nfunction Portfolio() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Portfolio Page</h1>\n      <div class=\"wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"wrapper1\">\n\n          <div class=\"easicuisi\">\n          <a href=\"https://benabbott85.github.io/Project-1/\">\n            <img className=\"portfolioimg\" src=\"https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Best-Meal-Planning-apps-mealime.png\" alt=\"easicuisi\"></img>\n          </a>\n          <h1 class=\"header1\"> EasiCuisi</h1>\n          <p class=\"para1\">- Project designed for user to be able to search for recipes based on protein type, serving size, \n          <br></br>\n          and cook time desired.\n          <br></br>\n          - Upon entering search criteria, user will be given results on modals based upon the API search.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"para3\">- Languages used: HTML, CSS, JQuery, APIs</p>\n          \n          <p class=\"para4\">- I was responsible for the APIs to be used as well as coordinating the JQuery code writing </p>\n          \n         \n          </div>\n\n          <div class=\"allocations\">\n          <a href=\"https://limitless-refuge-47363.herokuapp.com/\">\n            <img className=\"dayplanner\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f8/be/22/f8be222cc55ac83ce675b5d44a6fb073.png\" alt=\"easicuisi\"></img>\n          </a>\n          <h1 class=\"header2\"> AlLocations</h1>\n          <p class=\"para1\">- Project designed for users to be able to store information for an upcoming trip in one  \n          <br></br>\n          centralized place\n          <br></br>\n          - On landing page, user will be able to target upcoming trip, or future trips being planned\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"para3\">- Languages used: Node, Express, Handebars, Sequelize, Materialize</p>\n          \n          <p class=\"para4\">- I was responsible for the back end work on this project.
